# Comparable Interface.

(It is for default sorting order)

_It is present in java.lang.package. It contains only one method. Obj1.compareTo(Object obj2)_

````public int compareTo(Object obj)
	returns -ve iff obj1 has to come before obj2.
	returns +ve iff obj1 has to come after obj2.
	returns zero if both are equal.```
